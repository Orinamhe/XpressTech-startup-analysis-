Using SQL Server and Power BI, this project analyses and provides insight for a food delivery company 

**TASKS** 

Provide insights on food deliveries based on customer preferences

**METHOD** 

First exploratory data analysis done on Microsoft SQL Server. Further exploration, extraction and transformation done using Power Query. Modelling, data relationships and visualisations were done by Power BI.

**INSIGHTS** 

A greater proportion of the customers were male. Most respondents were between the ages 20-25 (about 68%).  Data shows that most responders were students (53%) and then workers (30%). Most users were also single (~ 70%) having some form of educational qualification (90%). Most of the respondents had between 10000 to 50000 as monthly income.
Respondents often ordered snacks or lunch as their first meal. While a number ordered dinner as their first meal, it contributed the most of the second meal ordered, suggesting an increase in demand for food ordered after school and close of work. Food delivery apps was the most preferred medium of ordering meals, and then directly calling the restaurants. Thus, an app with restaurants contact in place would be a great idea. Proper meals (breakfast, lunch or dinner) were meal preferences when respondents ordered food, compared to sweets, drinks or ice cream.

From reviews, the influence of time and rating of a restaurant greatly affected the choice of customers (about 75% in both cases). Good quantity, good taste and less delivery time were very important parameters also influencing choices of customers.  Respondents most favoured ease and convenience, time saving, more restaurant choices, google map accuracy and good tracking system from the results of a review survey. Other survey reviews provided additional information on customer habits.
